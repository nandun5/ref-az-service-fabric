- finally, write the title for this pr
- pr title for a story should look like #<pbi-id> feat(pe-Sample): story title in lower-case
- pr title for bug fixes look like #<bug-id> fix(pe-Sample): bug title in lower-case
- instead of 'feat' or 'fix', you can also say migrations, build, chore, ci, docs, style, refactor, or test and the '(pe-Sample)' is optional
- the '(pe-Sample)' is the scope nickname for everything in this repo
